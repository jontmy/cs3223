## Database Systems Implementations

> This system-oriented course provides an in-depth study of the concepts and implementation issues related to database management systems.

> Then it covers issues and techniques dealing with multi-user application environments, namely, transactions, concurrency control, and recovery.

> The third part covers advanced topics such as on-line analytical processing, in-memory databases, and column stores.
